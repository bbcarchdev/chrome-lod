Chrome LOD extension
====================

An extension for Chrome that looks for the presence of Linked Open
Data behind the pages you browse and if available, reveals the
underlying data.

Debugging/Building
------------------

In Chrome, open the tools/extensions page, ensure that developer mode
is selected, and click to 'load unpacked extension...'.  Select the
directory you checked out the chrome-lod source to.  This should
enable the extension directly.

In order to package the extension for deployment, use the 'pack
extension' button, which will result in a chrome-lod.crx file and
associated keyfile.

Rationale
---------

The extension runs once on each page you visit, looking for <link>
tags in the page with relationship 'meta' or 'alternate' pointing to a
URI with media-type application/rdf+xml or text/turtle.  Failing that,
the extension will attempt to do content negotiation on the current
URI, asking for application/rdf+xml or text/turtle representation of
the current resource.

If an RDF representation is available, it will be rendered behind the
current page and a peel-back animation will reveal the background RDF
data as the mouse hovers over the top left corner of the page.
