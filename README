Chrome LOD extension
====================

An extension for Chrome that looks for the presence of Linked Open
Data behind the pages you browse and if available, reveals the
underlying data.

Debugging/Building
------------------

In Chrome, open the tools/extensions page, ensure that developer mode
is selected, and click to 'load unpacked extension...'.  Select the
directory you checked out the chrome-lod source to.  This should
enable the extension directly.

In order to package the extension for deployment, use the 'pack
extension' button, which will result in a chrome-lod.crx file and
associated keyfile.

Rationale
---------

The extension runs once on each page you visit looking for any RDF
data it can find in the following order:

1) Any <link> tags in the page with relationship 'meta' or 'alternate'
pointing to a URI with media-type application/rdf+xml or text/turtle.

2) Any RDFa in the body of the HTML document.

3) Using content negotiation on the current URI, asking for
application/rdf+xml or text/turtle representation of the current
resource.

If an RDF representation is available, it will be rendered behind the
current page and a peel-back animation will reveal the background RDF
data as the mouse hovers over the top left corner of the page.

Checking what license is being applied and that it is usable.
